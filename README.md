There are three notebooks in this repo that examine various algorithms of a probability theory:
**Lab 1** Key topics within the notebook include probability theory, disjoint and conditional events, Bayes Law, expected value, standard deviation, entropy, 
as well as simulation of the randomized response privacy mechanism using real survey data. It contains marked code cells and markdown explanations that walk through statistical 
computations and related privacy techniques.

**Lab2** This notebook guides users through advanced data privacy techniques for publishing sensitive tabular datasets, focusing on k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness using a real-world health survey. The lab features hands-on coding and analysis with the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data.
**Key Sections and Topics:** k-Anonymity Analysis: Implements functions to calculate k-anonymity for various sets of quasi-identifiers, explores equivalence class distributions, and verifies theoretical subset properties.​
De-anonymization: Merges lab data with synthetic identity tables to perform re-identification attacks, extracting possible subject IDs for targeted individuals and showing practical privacy risks.​
l-Diversity and Entropy: Calculates l-diversity and entropy for sensitive columns across equivalence classes; generates histograms to evaluate utility-privacy tradeoffs and discusses the distribution's impact.​
t-Closeness and Earth Mover’s Distance: Implements t-closeness calculations using Earth Mover’s Distance to compare sensitive attribute distributions within groups against the global dataset; provides case studies showing which generalizations offer the strongest protection.​
